## Airbnb clone project ##
### project description ###
The project is a real world application designed to simulate the development of a robust booking like Airbnb which involves a deep dive into full-stack development. It focuses on backend systems database design API development and app security thus enabling the understanding of complex architectures workflows and collaborative team dynamics using technologies like **Django**, **docker** among others.

## Team Roles ##
### Business Analyst (BA) ###
Understands the customerâ€™s business processes, elicits and translates business needs into requirements, bridges between stakeholders and the development team.
### Product Owner (PO) ###
Owns the product vision and evolution, balances business needs and market demands, ensures the product meets customer requirements, manages the product backlog.

### Project Manager ###
Ensures that the project is delivered on time and within budget, plans and organizes tasks, motivates the team, and maintains communication and status transparency.
### UI/UX Designer ###
Designs the user interface and overall user experience, creates user journeys, wireframes, prototypes, ensures functionality is intuitive and visually appealing.
### Software Architect ###
Designs the high-level system architecture, selects tools and technologies, defines code quality standards, oversees architecture decisions and integration approaches.
### Software Developer ###
Implements features and functionality (front-end, back-end, or full stack), writes and maintains code, solves technical problems during development.
### Quality Assurance  Engineer ###
Verifies that the application meets both functional and non-functional requirements, identifies defects, runs tests, ensures quality across features.
### Test Automation Engineer ###
Builds and maintains automated test scripts and frameworks, selects areas suitable for automation, ensures automated tests provide reliable feedback.
### DevOps Engineer ###
Facilitates collaboration between development and operations, builds CI/CD pipelines, automates deployment and operations to accelerate delivery while maintaining stability.


## Technology stack ##
### Django ###
A web framework for building RESTful APIs and managing backend logic such as authentication, bookings, and property listings.

### PostgreSQL ###
A relational database used to store structured data like users, listings, reviews, and transactions securely and efficiently.

### GraphQL ###
A query language for APIs that lets clients request exactly the data they need, improving performance and flexibility.

### Celery ###
A task queue system for running background jobs like sending confirmation emails or processing payments asynchronously.

### Redis ###
An in-memory data store used for caching, managing sessions, and acting as a message broker for Celery tasks.

### Docker ###
A containerization tool that packages the app and its dependencies to ensure consistent deployment across environments.

### CI/CD Pipelines ###
Automated workflows for continuously testing, building, and deploying new updates safely and efficiently.

## **database design** ##
- users - id,name,email,role, created-on
- properties- id, host-id,title,location,price
- bookings - id, guest-id, check-in,check-out,status
- payments - id, booking-id, amount,payment method,status
- reviews - id, payment-id,guest-id,rating,comment

 ### **relationships** ###
- a host can have many properties
- a property can host many guests
- a user can review many properties
- a user can rate many properties
- a property can have many reviews
- a user can book many properties

## Feature Breakdown ##
### API Documentation ###
The apis are documented using OPENAPI standard to ensure easy understanding and interaction with all available endpoints.The system supports both Restful and flexible query based interactions by using Django REST framework and graphQL which improves integration for frontend and third party applications.

### User authentication ###
it manages user activities such as login, registration and profile management. This ensures personalised and safe user experience in the application.

### Property management ###
This allows owners to manage their property activity such as creating, retieving, and even deleting. This ensures secure uptodate accurate property data.

### Bookng system ###
This handles reservations by the guest where they can make, view or cancel bookings.it connects hosts users and properties by managing availability and schedules.

### Payment processing ###
It provides secure payment process where the users can track payment status safely. It provides trust and reliability through secure payments between guests and the hosts.

### reviews ###
This enables guests to post and manage reviews through writing and star rating hence promoting trust and transparency between clients and hosts.

### Database optimization ###
Caching and indexing are used to ensure faster data retrieval and reduce database load. This ensures the system remains fast, efficient and scallable.

## API Security ##
### User data protection ###
Encrypt all sensitive user information(passwords, personal details)
using strong hashing algorithms like bcrypt. this protects user data hence promoting trust and compliance to regulations.

### Authentication and authorization ###
Using secure authentication like JWT or Oauth 2.0 will ensure only a valid user gets into the system to performspecific tasks (RBAC) hence preventing identity theft and unauthorised operations

### secure payment processing ###
Process all payment transactions through third party gateways that support ssl/tls encryption to ensure card details are not exposed.

### Data transmission security ###
Using HTTPS with SSL certificates to encrypt data in transit btwn clients and the server will prevent hackers from tampering with the data.

### Input validation ###
validating all api inputs will prevent attacks like XSS, CSRF,and SQL injection.

### database security and backups ###
Restricting data access through strong authentication least-privilege policies and parametized queries. using automated backups will ensure data recovery hence promoting reliability.

### Logging and monitoring ###
Activity logging and real time monitoring will detect and respond quickly to breaches and suspicious activities.

## CI/CD Pipeline ##
TThese are tools used to automate the process of building, testing and deploying code changes. They work to ensure improved developmment speed,reduced human error and consistency.
