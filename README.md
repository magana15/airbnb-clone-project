### Django ###
A web framework for building RESTful APIs and managing backend logic such as authentication, bookings, and property listings.

### PostgreSQL ###
A relational database used to store structured data like users, listings, reviews, and transactions securely and efficiently.

### Redis ###
An in-memory data store used for caching, managing sessions, and acting as a message broker for Celery tasks.

### Docker ###
A containerization tool that packages the app and its dependencies to ensure consistent deployment across environments.

### CI/CD Pipelines ###
Automated workflows for continuously testing, building, and deploying new updates safely and efficiently.

## **database design** ##
users - id,name,email,role, created-on
properties- id, host-id,title,location,price
bookings - id, guest-id, check-in,check-out,status
payments - id, booking-id, amount,payment method,status
reviews - id, payment-id,guest-id,rating,comment

 ### **relationships** ###
- a host can have many properties
- a property can host many guests
- a user can review many properties
- a user can rate many properties
- a property can have many reviews
- a user can book many properties
